    <h1>The power of Quantum Computing!!</h1>

    <div class="bg"><p class="container container-center"> What are quantum computers?? Why do all the big companies like Google, IBM, NASA are spending so much over building them??
        <br><br>
        Well for now most of us know that these computers are much faster rather exponentially faster than normal computers. It is even said that a normal quantum computer beats the fastest ever supercomputer.
        <br><br>
        So what property of a Quantum computer makes it so fast and so in demand. Here comes the real magical component of a quantum computer, Drumrolls please 🥁🥁
        <br><br> <br>

        <br><br>
        What is a Qubit? An ordinary Computer Bit can store either 1 or 0 at a time but A Qubit stores a combination of 1 and 0 states. To understand this, you can take an example. Suppose you went to an Ice-cream Shop but you are confused about whether or not you want to eat Ice-cream. Your decision is completely random or may depend upon the Ice-cream flavors available, the quality of Ice-cream, your mood, and so on, it is all up to you. So, you are confused between ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ and only arrive at a decision when the Ice-cream vendor asks you.
        <br>
        Same is the case with a Qubit. It is confused between the states 1 and 0 and only arrives at a particular state when measured. Results may vary due to external and internal conditions. This phenomenon in physics is known as Quantum Superposition.
        <br><br>
        This property is the real power of Quantum computers. The ability of a Qubit to store multiple states at the same time and arrive at a particular state that can change by manipulating the conditions can change the way we look at our world. It can increase our calculation speed and storage capacity exponentially. Calculations that took years can just be solved in fractions of seconds or even less.
        <br><br>
        Let’s take for instance a normal 4 bits computer can store 4 bits of data whereas a 4-bit Quantum Computer can store up to 2^4 bits of data. Now imagine a Quantum Computer having storage capacity equal to a normal PC 🤯🤯. And on top of that using Special Quantum Gates for calculations, we can attain a processing speed of no match!!
